## Changes
* [`extras-cats`] Fix `innerFold` and `innerFoldF` for `F[Either[A, B]]` to have the same method signature as `Either`'s (#368)
  * `innerFold`
    ```scala
    def innerFold[D](ifLeft: => D)(f: B => D)(implicit F: Functor[F]): F[D]
    ```
    to
    ```scala
    def innerFold[D](forLeft: A => D)(forRight: B => D)(implicit F: Functor[F]): F[D]
    ```
  
  * `innerFoldF`
    ```scala
    def innerFoldF[D](ifLeft: => F[D])(f: B => F[D])(implicit F: FlatMap[F]): F[D]
    ```
    to
    ```scala
    def innerFoldF[D](forLeft: A => F[D])(forRight: B => F[D])(implicit F: FlatMap[F]): F[D]
    ```
