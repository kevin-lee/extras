  ```scala
  sealed trait Aaa
  object Aaa {
    final case class Bbb(n: Int) extends Aaa
    case object Ccc extends Aaa
  
    def bbb(n: Int): Aaa = Bbb(n)
    def ccc: Aaa         = Ccc
  }
  
  final case class Something[A](a: A)
  
  Aaa.bbb(123).nestedClassName
  // Aaa.Bbb
  
  Aaa.ccc.nestedTypeName
  // Aaa.Ccc
  ```
It was supposed to be released in `0.24.0` but wasn't included by mistake.
